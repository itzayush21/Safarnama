                Nagaland is a mountainous state in northeast India, bordering Myanmar. It's home to diverse indigenous tribes, with festivals and markets celebrating the different tribes' culture. Its capital city of Kohima suffered heavy fighting in World War II, commemorated by memorials at the Kohima War Cemetery. The Nagaland State Museum exhibits ancient weaponry, a ceremonial drum and other traditional Naga cultural artifacts.

It is bounded by Assam State and Dimapur District in the west and north western part respectively, as well as Kohima District and Manipur State in the east and south part respectively. Peren District is headquartered at Peren (about 1,445m above sea level). Peren, Jalukie and Tening are the major towns of the district. Most of the inhabitants belong to the Zeliang and Kuki tribes.

                        Kohima, situated in the south at an altitude of 1444m above sea level, occupies pride of place as the capital city of Nagaland. Sharing its borders with Dimapur and Peren District in the West, Zunheboto and Phek District in the East, Manipur State  in the South and Wokha District in the North. One of the oldest among the eleven districts of the state, Kohima is the first seat of modern administration as the Headquarters of Naga Hills District (then under Assam). When Nagaland became a full fledged state on 1st December, 1963, Kohima was christened as the capital of the state. Since then, parts of Kohima district have been carved out thrice – the first in 1973 when Phek District was created, then in 1998 Dimapur was carved out and declared as a separate district and it was in 2004 for the third time that Kohima district once again gave birth to one of the youngest districts in the state called Peren District.

Wokha is a trade and agricultural centre for the surrounding Naga Hills, in which grains (mainly rice) and fruits are grown on previously forested slopes. There are some cottage industries (weaving, pottery making, woodworking). The town is linked by highway to Mokokchung (northeast) and Kohima. Wokha was the scene of much British colonial military activity in the 1880s. The population of the town and its environs is predominantly Lotha, a Naga people. Pop. (2001) 37,636; (2011) 35,004.

                        During the British Rule of India the Mokokchung area was part of the Naga Hills District of Assam. The Mokokchung subdivision of Naga Hills District was created in 1889, and it remained so following India independence in 1947. Naga Hills District remained as a district of Assam until 1957, when it and Tuensang Frontier Division of the North-East Frontier Agency (now Arunachal Pradesh) were joined to form the centrally governed Naga Hills Tuensang Area. At that point Mokokchung sub-division became a district, one of three alongside Kohima and Tuensang districts. February 1961 saw the renaming of Naga Hills Tuensang Area to “Nagaland”, and in December 1963 Nagaland became the 16th state of India. Finally December 1973 saw the new districts of Zunheboto and Wokha carved out of Mokokchung, leaving the borders of Mokokchung district as they stand today.

                        The area comprising the present District of Tuensang remained totally unadministered in the pre-independence days. The British had declared it as an Excluded Area. The people had almost no contact with the outside world. Head hunting and other primitive practices were common and in fact a case of head hunting was reported as late as October 1963 at Panso in the District. In 1948, for the first time, an administrative center was established at Tuensang and in 1945 the area (including the present Mon, Longleng and Kiphire Districts) was brought under the North East Frontier Agency (NEFA) as the Tuensang Frontier Division. In 1957, the Tuensang Frontier Division was merged with the Naga Hills District of Assam to form an administrative unit called the Naga Hills Tuensang Area (NHTA). The administration of NHTA was the responsibility of the Govenor of Assam under the control of the Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India. There were only three districts at that time in Nagaland, Kohima, Mokokchung and Tuensang.

                        overing an area of 1786 Sq.km, the District of Mon is bounded in the North by Sibsagar District of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh in the north east, Myanmar in south east and Tuensang and Longleng districts of Nagaland in the south. The district is located between 94°49′ East longitude and 26°45′ North latitude at an altitude 897.64 meters above sea level. In terms of area, it is the 3rd biggest district representing 10.77% of the total area of Nagaland.

                        The area, which is now known as MON DISTRICT and is placed on the Northeastern part of the State of Nagaland, was not brought under the Civil Administration till 1948. Even in the beginning of the 19th Century, a vast tract of land lying between the administered areas of Assam and Myanmar (Burma) was not brought under the Civil Administration by the British. By the year 1914, the Foreign and Political Department of the Government of India, by a Notification, extended the Assam Frontier Tract Regulation of 1880 to the Hills, which were either inhabited or frequented by Abors, Mishmis, Singphos, Nagas, Khamptis, Bhutias, Akas and Daflas. It is by this extension of the aforesaid Regulation, the Government of India brought the area under some administration in 1914 and the area was named as the North East Frontier Tract. Hence, the present MON DISTRICT was also brought under same Notification but practically, there was no Civil Administration till 1948.
