                        Sirpur has a rich background of traditional cultural heritage and architecture. The archaeological remains are still a pride for this region. The Buddha Viharas in Sirpur are older than Nalanda. The town of sirpur has been mentioned in ancient epigraphic records, dating back to the 5th to the 8th centuries A.D. Drained by the pristine waters of the Mahanadi and facing the Barnawapara Wildlife Sanctuary on the Northeast, Sirpur is a small town, 84 kms from the capital, Raipur. Moving along from Raipur, one reaches Arang, from where one goes to Tumgaon. A road from here leads northwards, to Sirpur. It is an enriching experience to see how life goes on in these quiet villages, without getting affected by the hustle – bustle of the outside world.

                        Chitrakote waterfalls, also called as the mini Niagara Fall of India, bear the proud distinction of being the broadest waterfall in India. The majestic beauty is located 38 km from Jagdalpur in Bastar on the river Indrāvati. The water of the river flows through the dense vegetation and cascades from a height of about 95 feet. A horse-shoe shaped waterfall, best seen during and after the monsoon, between July and October. This paints a very beautiful sight.

The musical fountain, situated on the island in the artificial lake in Maitri Garden is a dynamic spectacle which responds to the music in a way that interprets the style and rhytmm of the musical performance. As the music plays, jets of water shoot in the air, twist, sway, pirouette, pulse, drum and skip with the beat – each movement lit by brilliant colours. 2 shows are organized here in the evenings, on alternate days. White tigers are the main attraction of the zoo. Every year a flower show is organized here.
