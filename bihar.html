                        Rajgir, meaning the abode of Gods, is a town in Nalanda district about 93 km southeast of Patna. It finds mention in the Mahabharata as the kingdom of Jarasandha, the arch nemesis of Krishna and his Yadava clan. While the exact date of Rajgir’s foundation is not known, the city is believed to be about 3000 years old. Rajgir is divided into two parts: one which is fortified and surrounded by seven hills and the other, which is believed to have been founded by King Bimbisara’s son, Ajatshatru. There are two local beliefs about the name of the town. One belief is that the town gets its name from the Hindi word  rajgriha which means royal house and the other states that the name comes from the rajgir (also a Hindi word), which means royal mountain.

                        The sacred city of Bodhgaya is located in Bihar. It is 12 km away from Gaya city. Bodhgaya is where the wandering prince Siddhartha sat under a Bodhi Tree to meditate. The first three days of his meditation and the following seven weeks of enlightenment have been closely associated with various places in Bodhgaya. The history of this town can be traced back to 500 BC. History mentions Bodhgaya as Bodhimanda and the main monastery as the Bodhimanda-vihara.

                        Rohtasgarh, one of the largest forts not only in India but in the whole world, is spread over a radius of 26 miles. The name of this area was named Rohtas after Rohtasgarh, established by Rohitashva, the son of Satyuga Suryavanshi king Satyaharishchandra. Since ancient times, there have been only four routes in all four directions to reach Rohtas hill, which are called Ghats. From these ghats (paths) the enemies could not easily come up and the guards kept on, due to which the gates have been made here.
